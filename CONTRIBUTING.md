## Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

If you have any substantial changes that you would like to make, please [open an issue](https://github.com/FrostCo/AdvancedProfanityFilter/issues/new) so we can discuss it and avoid any wasted efforts.

1. [Fork](https://github.com/github/view_component/fork) and clone the repository
2. Install Node.js
3. Install needed dev dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
6. Run tests and make sure they are all passing: `npm run test`
5. Make your changes, add tests (if applicable)
6. Run tests again to make sure they still pass
7. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/FrostCo/AdvancedProfanityFilter/compare)
8. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed, and be willing to answer questions or make adjustments as needed so that it can get merged

Tips for a good review process:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write tests if possible
- Write a good commit message. This project is aiming to use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/). For examples, look through the commit history.
- If you are adding a new feature, please include a section in the pull request with proposed text to be included in the [main wiki page](https://github.com/FrostCo/AdvancedProfanityFilter/wiki).

## Releases

Releases are controlled by project maintainers and don't have a set schedule. Releases often happen when a milestone is reached, a new feature is ready to go, or a bug has been fixed.
