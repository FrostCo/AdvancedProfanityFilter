### Tips for a Good Review Process

- **Keep your changes focused.**  
  If you're making multiple unrelated changes, consider submitting them as separate pull requests. This makes reviews easier and helps isolate future regressions.

- **Adding a new feature?**  
  Please include a section in your pull request describing what should be added to the [main wiki page](https://github.com/FrostCo/AdvancedProfanityFilter/wiki).

- **Write tests when possible.**  
  This helps maintain confidence and stability in the project over time.

- **Write a clear and consistent commit message.**  
  We follow the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention for commit messages. This keeps the commit history readable and easy to scan.

### Commit Message Format

You can use the [gitmoji-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitmoji-cli) to help write commits:

```bash
gitmoji -c
```

If you prefer not to install the CLI, follow this format (ignore the curly braces):

```txt
{emoji} ({scope}): {message}
```

**Example:**

```txt
âœ¨ (filter): Add exact match method for words
```
