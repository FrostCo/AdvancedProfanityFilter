### Beta Testing
If you would like to help with development, but don't have experience coding, its very helpful to have users test a release candidate before actually publishing it to everyone. If you are interested in testing new versions see [this page](https://github.com/richardfrost/AdvancedProfanityFilter/wiki/Beta-Testing) for more information.

#### Original
After years of using Simple Profanity Filter, I decided that it was time to give back to the community. Thanks markyd13 for all your work on this great extension!

### Development
I am moving the project over to Typescript to make it more pleasant to develop in.

```
sudo npm install typescript --global
```

```js
npm init
rename .js .ts *.js

npm install -g typescript

./build.sh
```
