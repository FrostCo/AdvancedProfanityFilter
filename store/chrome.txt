Advanced Profanity Filter helps to clean up bad language on the websites you and your family visit.
Whether you choose to censor, substitute, or hide offensive words, APF is here to improve your browsing experience. Individuals around the world can now be protected from profanity in their homes, organizations, and schools. APF has a variety of options to meet your personal needs.

APF is not limited to filtering text alone! With the use of captions and subtitles it can also mute audio while you sit back and relax to watch your favorite movies and shows from a collection of supported sites. Have a suggestion for a new supported site? Contact us!
